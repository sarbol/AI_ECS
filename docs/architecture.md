# System Architecture Overview

## Overview
The AI-Based Environmental Control System (ECS) is designed to optimize home environments for the elderly and disabled. It integrates AI, IoT devices, and a user-friendly interface to provide real-time adjustments based on user needs and environmental conditions.

## Components
- **Backend**: A Python-based framework (e.g., Flask) that handles API requests, interacts with AI models, and manages IoT devices.
- **AI Models**: Used for predicting and optimizing environmental conditions.
- **IoT Devices**: Sensors and actuators that monitor and adjust the environment.
- **Frontend**: Web and mobile interfaces for user interaction.

## Data Flow
1. Sensors collect environmental data.
2. Data is processed and stored.
3. AI models analyze the data and make predictions.
4. The system adjusts the environment via IoT devices.
5. Users interact with the system through the web/mobile app.

## Deployment
The system is deployed using Docker and managed via Kubernetes for scalability.
